Overview
This script is designed for Penetration Testing professionals who need to generate weak or common password combinations based on user names, company names, and other words. It allows for multithreading to efficiently process multiple users and words, and provides options to customize the password generation process.

Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries are required.
Installation
Copy the script to a directory of your choice.
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Usage
The script can be run from the command line with various arguments to customize its behavior. Below are the available arguments:

-u, --users: Comma delimited list of usernames or a file containing a list of usernames.
-c, --companies: Comma delimited list of company names or a file containing a list of company names.
-w, --words: Comma delimited list of words or a file containing a list of words.
-x, --exclude_defaults: Exclude a predefined list of default passwords from the generation process.
-s, --simple: Generate a simpler set of password combinations.
-t, --threads: Number of threads to use for processing. Default is 4.
-i, --input: Take additional words as input from the command line.
Basic Usage Example
shell
Copy code
python password_generator.py -u users.txt -c companies.txt -w words.txt
This command will read usernames from users.txt, company names from companies.txt, and words from words.txt, then generate password combinations based on these.

Advanced Usage Example
shell
Copy code
python password_generator.py -u "user1,user2" -c "company1,company2" -w "word1,word2" -t 8 -s
This command specifies users, companies, and words directly in the command line, sets the number of threads to 8, and enables simple password combination generation.

Interactive Mode
If you run the script with the -i flag, you can input additional words interactively:

shell
Copy code
python password_generator.py -i
Output
The script will print the generated passwords to the console. It's advisable to redirect the output to a file for further use:

shell
Copy code
python password_generator.py [arguments] > output.txt
